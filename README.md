## Project Description
Sew Organized is an online catalog of my sewing pattern collection.

The home page of Sew Organized is a gallery of all the patterns that have been added to the catalog and they are sorted alphabetically.

Using the "Brands" or "Categories" dropdowns in the naviagtion bar, users can view all of the patterns under the filter chosen.

To create a new pattern listing, users can click on the "Create New" button in the navigation bar and they will be brought to a page to fill out the information of the pattern.

Users can view a pattern by clicking on it's image or pattern name and this brings them a new page with an image carousel and all the pattern details.

Within the pattern page, users can edit and delete the pattern listing or return to the home page via the back button.

## User Stories
### MVP Goals
As a user, I want to see a gallery of all the patterns in my collection.

As a user, I want to click on a pattern to see more information about it.

As a user, I want the ability to edit a pattern listing.

As a user, I want the ability to delete a pattern listing.


### Stretch Goals
As a user, I want to be able to filter my patterns using different criteria.

As a user, I want the ability to filter patterns by how much fabric they'd need.

As a user, I want the ability to keep a wishlist off all the patterns I'd like to add to my collection.

As a user, I want to enable user authentication with passport.js.


## Features to Improve in Future
- Add search feature to allow users to search using key words included in the description of patterns.
- Add advanced search feature to allow users to use several different criteria to filter, instead of just the Brands and Categories dropdowns.
- Improve responsivemeness of all elements so they do more than just minimize as the screen gets more narrow.
- Add ability to create different users and Enable user authentication with passport.js

**Ultimate Goal**: Restructure project so it serves as a database of all sewing patterns and different users can have their own collection saved, as well as keep a running whishlist.
